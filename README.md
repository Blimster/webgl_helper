# webgl_helper

A small helper library to reduce boilerplate code when using the WebGL API.

## Features

The development of this library has just started. Many features are not completely implemented yet or missing at all.

- Reduces boilerplate code, e.g. connecting buffers to vertex attrib locations and draw in 1 call.
- Makes the WebGL API more type safe by adding types for a number of WebGL constants.

This library is **not** a high level library like [three.js](http://threejs.org).
